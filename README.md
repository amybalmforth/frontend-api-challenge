# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

This is my attempt at the Makers Academy Frontend API challenge:

```
We are going to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

The scenario is similar to the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge), except someone has already built a backend API for you and hosted it on Heroku.

Your task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript. [The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports. Implement as many as you see fit.

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*
* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps
```

I have managed to implement the following:

- Viewing all peeps
- Creating a user
- Logging in

I am still attempting to be able to get the user to post a peep.
